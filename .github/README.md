# 🗄️ Dotfiles

Dotfiles managed with [yadm](https://yadm.io/). These dotfiles have been tested
on `macos`. The plan is to eventually test and support severael `linux`
distributions as well. This detailed README helps me remember the setup :joy:

## 📦 Installation

First, install [`yadm`](https://yadm.io/docs/install). Then, clone the
repository with `yadm` and run `bootstrap`.

```bash
# clone repository
yadm clone https://github.com/salimhamed/dotfiles.git

# set the class to either `Personal` or `Work`
yadm config local.class Personal

# bootstrap the environment
yadm bootstrap
```

## 🏃 Usage

### 🚀 Alacritty

[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is a terminal emulator that
comes with sensible defaults and is configured with `yaml` files, which can be
more easily managed with version control systems.

#### Alacritty Keymaps

| Keybinding  | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `C-S-Space` | Enter [Vi Mode](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/docs/features.md#vi-mode) |

### 💻 Tmux

Tmux is used as a terminal multiplexer to manage multiple terminal sessions,
split screens, and easily switch between them. The
[dracula/tmux](https://github.com/dracula/tmux) plugin is installed for a better
status bar and dark mode. The
[tmux-resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect) plugin is
installed to save and restore tmux sessions after system restart.

#### Tmux Keymaps

The `<Prefix>` Keybinding has been remapped to `C-a`, replacing the default
`C-b`.
